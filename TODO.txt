5.  Create config file for initial default resources:
	Low EC  percentage or absolute value
	Low airspeed (configurable per vessel) stall warning ???? not a resource, maybe add to DangerAlert instead
	Low fuel (tank)
	Low fuel (all active tanks)



1.  Config file for common resources
		Default:  EC, liquidfuel, oxidizer, monoprop, xenon

1.1.  Write code to read from config file
1.2.  Write code to save values to config file

2.  Use icons from ARP: 
		zer0Kerbal: https://spacedock.info/mod/2403
		zer0Kerbal: https://spacedock.info/mod/15 (ARPIcons - formerly Olympic1's ARP Icons)

4.	Write code to apply to all desired vessels, check intervals to be longer


5.	Write all available resources to txt file on startup for reference

	CommonResources
